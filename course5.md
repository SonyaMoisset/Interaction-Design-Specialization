# Interaction Design Specialization
## Designing, Running, and Analyzing Experiments
### About the Course:
You will never know whether you have an effective user experience until you have tested it with users. In this course, you’ll learn how to design experiments, how to run experiments, and how to analyze data from these experiments in order to evaluate and validate user experiences. You will work through real-world examples of experiments from the fields of IxD and HCI, understanding issues in experiment design and analysis. You will analyze multiple data sets using recipes given to you in the R statistical programming language -- no prior programming experience is assumed or required. By the end of the course, you will be able to knowledgeably design, run, and analyze your own experiments for putting empirical and statistical weight behind your designs.

#### Week 1
##### Basic Experiment Design Concepts
In this module, you will learn basic concepts relevant to the design and analysis of experiments, including mean comparisons, variance, statistical significance, practical significance, sampling, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and informed consent. You’ll also learn to think of an experiment in terms of its participants, apparatus, procedure, and design & analysis.
