## Social Computing
### About the Course:
People are social creatures and the modern Internet reflects that. Technology has made collaboration at a distance possible in new ways that present their own set of challenges. This course will introduce you to the major challenges and opportunities for creating online communities. What does the future hold? Learn how social computing can create collaboration experiences that go beyond what’s possible face to face.

#### Week 1
##### Connecting People through Technology
When you think of social media, you might think of a popular social network, like Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn. These are indeed powerful, but the universe of social media is much larger. Both online and off, most everything we do has a social component that is mediated by some technology. After all, technologies have been helping people communicate since long before your favorite curly-haired CEO dropped out of college. In this module, you’ll learn about different types of social software, how to think about physical collaboration and digital collaboration using the same framework, and what the challenges to success for collaborative software are.
